Commonly-used functions and checks for initial exploratory analysis of data transformations, EDA and modeling.

> ### **Contents**

* Context
* `analyze`: summary statistics, coverage, and outliers.
* `feature_engineering`: one-hot encoding and handling datetimestamps.
* `model_assumptions`: generating collinearity plots.

> ### **Context**

The Machine Learning Model Pipeline can be summarized by this comprehensive and succinct figure (though another excellent diagram on the infrastructure needs can be found [here](https://docs.metaflow.org/introduction/what-is-metaflow).
